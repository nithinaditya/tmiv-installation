= Abstract

The Video working group has established the Draft International Standard and the 8^th^ Test Model for MPEG Immersive Video during the 133^rd^ MPEG meeting (January 2021) after evaluating the core experiment results and related contributions.
The test model consists of this document and the reference software, providing an encoder and decoder/renderer in alignment with the specification.
This document serves as a source of general tutorial information on the MPEG Immersive Video (MIV) design.
It defines terminology used, process and data flow, operating modes, and description of algorithmic components adopted by the video group for the test model.
